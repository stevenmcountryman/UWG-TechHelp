# UWG-TechHelp
This is the GIT Repo for my UWG TechHelp app for Windows 10 UWP, Android, and iOS.
This project is for my Independent Study with Dr. Yoder at the University of West Georgia - Summer 2016

This app has the following functions:

  For UWG employees:
  
    1) Submit new tickets
    2) View UWG services and their current statuses
    3) View quick help instructions for common issues
    4) View and update current contact info, office hours, and devices list
    5) Reply to tickets
    6) View submitted tickets and their current statuses
    
  For UWG ITS Employees:
  
    1) Everything above
    2) View tickets assigned to them and their IT groups
    3) Edit tickets (reassign, respond, resolve)
    
This app was originally written for Windows 10 UWP with Windows 10 MDL2 design controls, XAML, and C#. I will be rebuilding the app from the ground up to use XAMARIN controls, XAML, and C# with the hope of sharing most or all code across all three platforms.
